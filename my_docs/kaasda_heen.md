Ḵaasda Héen
===

This document answers some potential questions related to the name of the project.

## Overview

In Sitka, the river that this project focuses on is known by most residents as Indian River. But the original indigenous name was Ḵaasda Héen, long before outsiders came and started calling it Indian River. Out of respect for the people who have lived here for the past 10,000 years, this project refers to the river by its original name.

It should be noted that the USGS, which operates the stream gauge, refers to the river as Indian River. That name will appear in places because of this usage.

## References

I am using a number of references for how to spell the river's name, and how to use the name appropriately.

The text [Haa Léelk'w Hás Aaní Saax'ú](https://sealaska-heritage-store.myshopify.com/products/our-grandparents-names-on-the-land-paperback) has been helpful for understanding the name and its origin. This book combines the separate words into one, Ḵaasdahéen, but most other sources I have seen separate the name into two capitalized words.

The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_River_(Alaska)) about the river also lists the original name.

I also have ongoing conversations with people here in Sitka about the usage of indigenous place names, and the stories behind these names.

## Meaning

I will quote from Haa Léelk'w Hás Aaní Saax'ú to share the meaning of the name Ḵaasda Héen:

> There used to be three smokehouses beside the river [Indian River] where the Kiks.ádi stayed. Coming in from the bay [Jamestown Bay] with the tide they saw a little dugout canoe coming up the river with people in it. And from the three smokehouses that were alongside the river the Kiks.ádi came out. One of them hollered, "I wonder who you are and where are you from." And one of the persons who stood up in the canoe, one of them stood up in the small canoe, and said, "We are moving from Sockeye River [G&#817;athéeni, #422] in Frog Bay [Xixch´i G&#817;eeyí, a.k.a. Silver Bay, #410] to our river, K&#817;aasdahéen." And as soon as the person said this, it went down into the water. And what floated up in its place was a boom log on which three frogs were sitting. Because of this vision, the Kiks.ádi people to this day still call this place &#817;Kaasdahéen [Man's* Stream], the name that the frog people gave it. (pers. comm. 1998)

This is from page 81 in the book. The numbers in this passage refer to maps in the book that show the locations and features that these place names refer to. If you are interested in the meaning of these names, I recommend this book, and recommend speaking with people local to this area who know these names firsthand.

## Typography

If you're using the name once, feel free to copy it from any source that has the correct diacritic marks.

On macOS, you can type any character with the accent mark (á) by typing Option-e and then the letter you want to mark.

The mark under the Ḵ is a [macron below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_below). This mark has its own unicode character, and the letter Ḵ with the mark has its own unicode character: `U+1E34`  `&#7732`.

## Usage

The word Héen means river, so the name Ḵaasda Héen stands alone; you would not write "Ḵaasda Héen River".
