This document explains the rationale for notifications, and how to use them.

## Rationale

This is a pilot project, to determine how the Kaasda HÃ©en river gauge can be used to monitor risk of landslides in real time. The analysis is fairly simple, but understanding the visualization is not straightforward at first.

The main site tries to communicate the basic aspect of the project under normal conditions. However, since this is a farily new approach to landslide monitoring, there are a number of conditions that can arise which may require real-time notices. For example if a long period of steady rain causes the river to rise to about 24', this analysis becomes unreliable. In order to be considered critical, the river needs to rise at a critical rate for an additional 2.5 feet. This is impossible above ~24 feet, because that puts the river at record levels and probably indicates filling the floodplain rather than continuing to rise. Additional heavier rain under these conditions would significantly increase landslide risk, without showing up on the river gauge. In the long term this could probably be automated, but for now this should be called out. Also, weather events are likely to arise that will warrant specific callouts.

The people behind this project are not meteorologists, so these notifications need to be carefully considered. It should be made clear that no notification will ever be made to tell people to evacuate. The only notification in a situation requiring evacuation would be a message to listen to local authorities.
