  <p>There were a significant number of heavy rain events in the late summer, fall, and early winter of 2020. One such event occurred on 7/26/2020. Here is a snapshot of what this analysis looked like on that day:</p>

  <p>Heavy rain started in the early morning hours of 7/26/2020. Conditions almost reached a critical point shortly after 7:00 am, but a critical point never occurred.</p>

  <p>This is an interesting event to consider when deciding what critical factors to use. If the critical factors were changed slightly, this event would have been flagged. There are a significant number of almost-critical events. Fortunately, it seems there is a set of values for the critical factors that ignore heavy rain events like this that don't lead to slides, but flag events that are associated with slides.</p>

  <p>Here's what this event would have looked like in real time:</p>
