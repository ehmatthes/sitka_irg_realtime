Realtime analysis of the Ḵaasda Héen stream gauge in Sitka
===

This is a project to help the residents of Sitka understand the real-time risk of landslides in the local area. The goal is to help people know when there is an imminent risk of slides, and also to know when there is low risk even though it seems to be raining hard.

The current project is not yet available to the public, because it is under active development. You are welcome to run this project locally, and see how it affects your understanding of landslide risk.

If you want to run the project locally, see the [documentation](my_docs/running_locally.md).

If you are interested in this project, you should also check out [sitka_irg_analysis](https://github.com/ehmatthes/sitka_irg_analysis), which is the historical analysis which this project is based upon.

Feel free to get in touch; I'm ehmatthes at gmail, and this project is being developed in collaboration with the [landslide working group](https://sitkascience.org/research-projects/landslide-research/) at [Sitka Sound Science Center](https://sitkascience.org).
